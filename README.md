# mplan - shell version
## install
- clone repository and save it somewhere safe
- create ~/.mplan
- alias the script for ease of use (I find that using 'tod' (for todo) can ease things quite a bit
  on QWERTY keyboards.)

## usage
Use `mplan.sh help` to get usage information. 

## about
This is the successor of [splan], and is not just simple, but microscopically small.
mplan supports multi-line notes from standard input with `mplan.sh add`.

The software is not stable, and is kept as such so as to be *very* simple. Please consider using it
carefully.

In short, this license means that you can do whatever you want with the software given you share it under the same license.
